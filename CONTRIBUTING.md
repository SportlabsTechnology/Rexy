GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in **Rexy**. Be sure to check our [documentation](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/Rexy), [FAQ](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/Rexy/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/vadymmarkov/Rexy/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
